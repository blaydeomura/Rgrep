# Rrestricted Grep
- Created a specialized version of the UNIX utility "grep," named "rgrep," using the C programming language, 
  which searches for and matches patterns in text files using a limited set of regular operators
- Rgrep can read and filter lines of text from standard input, printing the lines that match the specified pattern to standard output
